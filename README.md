# ConvoFlow-Source-Code

The source code for my 24 hour Eleven Labs Hack-a-thon submission

The entirety of this project was made in about 18 hours, the rest of the time was spent
creating the presentation video to go along with it

keep in mind that if you want to run this project for yourself you will need a few things
-it utilizes GPT 3, so an OpenAI api key is required
-it utilizes ElevenLabs voice AI, so an ElevenLabs API key is required.
-both of these keys should be placed within the .env
